//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
const movies = ['Independence Day', 'Starwars', 'The Godfather'];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = movies[0];

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let moviesLength = movies.length;

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. 
//What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastElem = movies[movies.length - 1];
